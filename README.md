# Dusk Valley

Welcome to the repository of Dusk Valley, an action platformer game with rogue-like elements and cooldown abilities. Set on a sci-fi planet interconnected by ancient portals, you'll find yourself fighting a range of enemies, engaging in boss fights, and even getting a glimpse of the game's lore through some simple NPC dialogues. test

## About the game
This game is still in its early stages, but our vision for Dusk Valley is to create an hour's worth of thrilling gameplay. We're looking forward to adding more features that will not only enhance the player experience but also make the game world feel more immersive and lively.

## Development
As the game is currently in its early demo phase, we plan on building upon the current gameplay elements and fleshing out the game world. We're excited about the quality of life improvements and new features we have in the pipeline to make Dusk Valley more fun and engaging.

Your constructive feedback is invaluable to us! Feel free to open an issue or send us an email with your thoughts, suggestions, and ideas. We would love to hear from you.

Our goal is to release a demo version by this summer and complete the game by the end of the year.

+ Ammo limit for guns
